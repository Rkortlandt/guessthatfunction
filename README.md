Welcome to **Rational Guesser**! This is a two-player game where you try to guess your opponent's secret function by asking questions and eliminating possibilities. Follow these steps to play:

## Getting Started

### Access the Game

Good luck hosting it :D 

### Join/Create a Room

One player needs to enter a 5-digit room code in the "**Enter 5-digit room code**" box and click "**Join Room**." This will create the room.

The second player must enter the exact same 5-digit room code and click "**Join Room**" to join the existing game.

## Setting Up Your Game

### Select Your Secret Function

Once both players are in the room, you'll each need to select your "**secret function**." This is the function your opponent will try to guess.

On your screen, you'll see "**Select your secret function!**" along with several function graphs.

Choose one of the functions by clicking the "**Select as Secret**" button below it.

## Playing the Game

### Taking Turns

The game proceeds in turns. One player asks a question, and the other player answers, allowing the questioner to eliminate functions.

### Asking Questions & Eliminating

When it's your turn to "**ask/eliminate**," you'll see your control panel indicating "**It's your turn to ask/eliminate!**"

You can ask your opponent a question about their secret function (e.g., "Does your function have any asymptotes?").

Based on their answer, you'll then eliminate functions from your board that don't fit the criteria. Click the "**Eliminate**" button below the functions you want to remove.

**Important Rule:** You can't make a final guess immediately after asking a question. You must eliminate functions first.

When you're done eliminating, click the "**Done Eliminating / Next Action**" button.

Hereâ€™s an example of the game in progress, showing a player's secret function and the turn indicator:

## Making a Final Guess

### Initiating a Guess

When you feel confident you know your opponent's secret function, you can make a final guess.

Click the "**Make Final Guess**" button. You'll see how many guesses you have left (e.g., "5 left").

### Selecting Your Guess

After clicking "**Make Final Guess**," you'll be prompted to select the function you believe is your opponent's secret function.

Choose the function by clicking its corresponding button.

**Guess Limit:** You have a total of five guesses. If you use all five guesses and haven't identified the correct function, you lose the game.

## Winning and Losing

The first player to correctly guess their opponent's secret function wins!

If you run out of guesses, you lose.

Good luck, and have fun playing **Rational Guesser**!
